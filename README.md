# Read Me First
This project demonstrate a simple SQL injection vulnerability on a SpringBoot project
The project runs a servlet serving two endpoints:
* '/' with a simple Hello the world answer
*  '/person/address' which maps the 'name' GET parameter to a SQL query (the vulnerability)
* the initial DB setup has a PEOPLE table populated with one entry for the name 'foo'
* as default, the application listens on port 8080 and also maps the H2 DB console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
